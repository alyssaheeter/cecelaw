# Cece Law Brand Kit

This repository provides a complete **brand kit** for **Cece Law**, a criminal‑defense and personal‑injury law firm serving the Chicago area.  It consolidates the visual identity, typography, colours, imagery recommendations and core website copy into a single, easy‑to‑use resource.  Use these materials to design consistent marketing collateral, a Squarespace site, business cards or presentations.

## Firm Overview

Cece Law was founded by **Attorney Frank Cece Jr.**, a former Cook County prosecutor who now defends individuals facing criminal charges or seeking compensation for injuries.  The firm’s tag line is **“Aggressively defends and protects your rights”**—it evokes both strength and compassion.  The brand voice should feel authoritative, trustworthy and empathetic without being intimidating.  Imagery should depict the cityscapes of Chicago and the courage of individuals fighting for justice.
